# LGMVIP--DataScience--Task2
Project 2 involved conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a terrorism dataset. EDA is a crucial step in understanding and gaining insights from the data before building models or making informed decisions.

In this project, various libraries such as pandas and matplotlib were utilized to explore and analyze the terrorism dataset. The dataset was carefully examined to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships among different variables.

Through visualizations, statistical summaries, and data manipulation techniques, we delved into the dataset's attributes, including the types of attacks, locations, target groups, and the impact of terrorism over time. Key objectives of the EDA were to identify hotspots, analyze the frequency of attacks, and examine the correlation between different factors.

The project aimed to provide valuable insights to stakeholders, security agencies, or policymakers, enabling them to make informed decisions and develop strategies to combat terrorism effectively.

By conducting thorough EDA, we gained a comprehensive understanding of the terrorism dataset, identified significant patterns and trends, and provided actionable insights to support decision-making processes in addressing this critical issue.
